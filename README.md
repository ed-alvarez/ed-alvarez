### Hello üëãüèª

I'm Eduardo.

I am a problem-solver engineer who enjoys working in industrial and critical environments. **Downtime is a big no for me**. FreeBSD user since I was a kid, experienced in low-level and massively-scalable soft real-time systems with requirements on high availability.

Always taking all kinds of projects and deadlines with the same level of commitment.

Shoot me an email, let's talk about your project:

```erl

```

Hope you stay awhile, and remember: [enjoy yourself](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzj4gHuH2LA).
