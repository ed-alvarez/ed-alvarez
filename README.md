### Hello 👋🏻

I'm Eduardo 🇨🇺

I am a solutions engineer who enjoys working in industrial, cloud, and critical environments. **Downtime is a big no for me**. FreeBSD user since I was a kid, experienced in low-level and massively-scalable soft real-time systems with requirements on high availability.

Shoot me an email, let's talk about your project:
