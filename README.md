### Hello 👋🏻

I'm Eduardo 🇨🇺

I am a solutions engineer who enjoys working in industrial, cloud, and critical environments. **Downtime is a big no for me**. Debian user since I was a kid, experienced in low-level, scalable, and realtime systems with requirements on high availability and a solid believer of the right tool for the right job!

You think it, I code it. Let's talk about your project and ideas:
